## Data Sources
The analysis is based on EV data, which includes:

* **Total Vehicles**: The total number of EVs recorded.
* **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV)**: Pure electric vehicles.
* **Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV)**: Vehicles with both electric and internal combustion engines.
* **Model and Make**: Details about different EV models and manufacturers.
* **State-wise Distribution**: Number of EVs across different states.
* **CAFV Eligibility**: Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle eligibility status.
## Project Objectives
* Analyze the distribution of total, BEV, and PHEV vehicles.
* Understand the average electric range of EVs.
* Evaluate the distribution of EVs by model year and state.
* Identify key manufacturers and their market share.
* Assess the eligibility of vehicles for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) status.
## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* **Average Electric Range**: 67.83 miles
* **Total Vehicles**: 150,413
* **Total BEV Vehicles**: 116,745 (77.6% of total)
* **Total PHEV Vehicles**: 33,668 (22.4% of total)
* **CAFV Eligibility**:
  - Eligible: 41.81% (62,887 vehicles)
  - Not Eligible: 11.85% (17,829 vehicles)
  - Unknown: 46.34% (69,697 vehicles)
## Skills Demonstrated
